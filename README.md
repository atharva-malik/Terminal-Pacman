This game is a 100% accurate (based on the original Pac-Man Game) Pac-Man copy in the terminal. It comes with all the main game states and all four ghosts, Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde.

## Feature
- Ready to run
- 100% Accurate
- Simple, intuitive UI
- Runs with native 60 FPS!

## Technologies Used
This game is made with [Python 3.11.5] and uses only the [Keyboard] module for input. The game, other than the Keyboard module, is made entirely with either built-in modules or native Python.

## Installation/Execution
To run the game, you must download and install [Python 3+], install the [Keyboard] module with `pip install keyboard`, download the source code, and run the `main.py` file

## Controls
The controls of this game are:
(W): Up
(A): Left
(S): Down
(D): Right

The game supports input stacking, where you can store upto one value into the future where that control will be executed as soon as it is a valid input!

## Development
Want to contribute? Great! Pull requests and issues are welcome! [Here] is an excellent guide on how to create pull requests and forks to request changes. I suggest using the addon "Better Comments" on Visual Studio Code as it makes the comments more readable. If you can not use the addon, I have used the following tags to make the comments more readable:

- //todo: This is a todo
- //*: This explains the code
- //!: This is a warning
